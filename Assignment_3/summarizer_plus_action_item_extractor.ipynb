    "# Good morning, everyone. Let's keep this quick but thorough. We'll go team member by team member and then do a short backlog grooming. Please mention blockers, new bugs, and any action items. Jack, you're up first.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Jack:\n",
    "# Yeah, so I finished the API rate-limiting middleware yesterday and deployed it to staging. QA found one bug – if a token is missing, it throws a 500 instead of a 401. I'll fix that today.\n",
    "# Also, I was supposed to start on the user analytics dashboard backend, but we realized the schema for event_logs isn't finalized. I'll talk to Sam after the meeting. No blockers otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Anna:\n",
    "# Got it. Bug sounds urgent. Please raise a ticket. And let's Slack Sam to finalize the schema – I'll do that.\n",
    "# Next, Maria?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Maria:\n",
    "# Thanks. I wrapped up the design updates for the login page, pushed to feature/login-redesign. There's an open PR.\n",
    "# I noticed that the forgot-password page doesn't have a responsive layout – I'll fix that today.\n",
    "# Also, we had a mix-up. The new feature flag toggle UI task was unassigned but marked in sprint planning. I think it was meant for me?\n",

    "# Anna:\n",
    "# Yes, thanks for catching that. Can you take it?\n",

    "# Great. Sam?\n",

    "# Sam:\n",
    "# Morning! So, still working on cleaning the event logs for dashboard reporting. I've had to rewrite a few ETL jobs – there's a weird edge case where user_id is null for anonymous events. I'll fix it today and finalize the schema before lunch.\n",
    "# Also, someone needs to inform the marketing team that their requested funnel metrics will be delayed – anyone want to take that?\n",

    "# David:\n",

    "# 1.\tThe new login design sometimes overlays the spinner and the input field.\n",
    "# 2.\tOn smaller screens, the sidebar navigation breaks.\n",
    "# 3.\tAnd the biometric login sometimes crashes on older Android versions.\n",
    "# I've logged bugs 1 and 2 in Jira. Bug 3 I need to test a bit more – might be OS-specific.\n",

    "# Jack:\n",
    "# Actually, yeah. About the cache invalidation for the user profile updates… We've had a few reports that changes don't reflect immediately in the mobile app. It's not technically a bug, but it's a poor user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "# David:\n",
    "# Oh right, I saw that too. I assumed it was expected behavior, but now that you mention it, it's kind of jarring.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Jack:\n",
    "# I could add a hook to purge the cache on successful update, but we'd need to be careful about race conditions. Maybe we should brainstorm a more solid fix.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Sam:\n",
    "# Oh, and before I forget—I had a conversation with James in Legal last week. He mentioned we need to audit user data retention in the analytics pipeline. It's not urgent, but we probably need a plan by the end of the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Anna:\n",
    "# That's... yeah. A big one. Can you write a doc with the current flow and mark any areas we're unsure about?\n",
