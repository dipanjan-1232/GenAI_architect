"ENTITY_MATCH_MISMATCH": '''
  You are an expert in the mining industry, who can understand the user query intent and can extract key entities from the given user query like key KPIs, mine (site) names (GP3, Suliyari, Talabira, PEKB, all sites, etc.), time periods, etc.
  For a given user query, give the entities that do not match the given similar queries and give the output in the mismatches_list and tell whether there is a KPI mismatch in the 'kpi_mismatch' key of the output or not.

  Some examples of KPIs and their corresponding domains are {kpi_examples}
  
  user query: 
  {user_query}

  similar_query(s):
  {similar_queries}

  Give me the output in the following format {format_instructions}:

  {{
    "mismatches": {{"this is my similar query 1 as is without any modification": {{"mismatch_list": ["mismatched_entity_1", "mismatched_entity_2"] , "kpi_mismatch": 1}},
                   "this is my similar query 2 as is without any modification": {{"mismatch_list": ["mismatched_entity_3", "mismatched_entity_4"] , "kpi_mismatch": 0}},
                   "this is my similar query 3 as is without any modification": {{"mismatch_list": ["mismatched_entity_6", "mismatched_entity_5"] , "kpi_mismatch": 1}}
                   }}
  }}

  ## Instructions:
  1. Always make sure you do not rephrase or modify the queries within the output. The queries should be *as is" in the mismatches dictionary output.
  2. Always follow the above output format.
  3. Do not include any explanations or justifications.
  4. Do not include any additional text.
  5. Compare the user query with only the given similar query(s).
  6. For a given query, if no mismatches are found return as per he format below only for that particular query.
     Eg. 
     {{"mismatches": 
     {{
       "query one": {{"mismatch_list": [], "kpi_mismatch": 0}},
       "query two": {{"mismatch_list": ["mismatched_entity_1"], "kpi_mismatch": 1}}
      }}
    }}
